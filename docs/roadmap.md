---

## 🚨 Phase 0 — Critical Bug Fixes & Security Hardening ✅

> **Status: COMPLETED** — All critical issues resolved.

- [x] **JWT Secret Key Management Hardening:**
  - Added `.jwt_secret` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental secret key exposure in version control.
  - Documented mandatory `.env` configuration for production deployments via `.env.example`.
- [x] **User Store Thread Safety Fix:**
  - Replaced `threading.Lock` with `threading.RLock` in `UserStore` to prevent deadlocks from nested `get_user()` calls within `authenticate_user()`.
- [x] **Core `__init__.py` Export Fix:**
  - Added missing `SAMPLE_DB_PATH` import in `src/core/__init__.py` to resolve potential `ImportError` at runtime.
- [x] **Stream Endpoint Audit Logging:**
  - Implemented full audit trail logging for `/api/v1/query-stream` endpoint with answer capture and duration tracking.
- [x] **SQLite Connection Lifecycle Management:**
  - Implemented proper connection cleanup for the LangGraph `SqliteSaver` checkpointer via `agent.cleanup()`.
  - Added graceful shutdown hooks in FastAPI lifespan via `cleanup_services()`.
- [x] **`.env.example` Template:**
  - Created comprehensive `.env.example` documenting all environment variables with safe defaults and inline comments.

## 🔍 Phase 1 — Advanced Retrieval & Structured Ingestion

- [ ] **Hybrid Search (BM25 + Dense Vector with Reciprocal Rank Fusion):**
  - Merge semantic dense vector search with sparse keyword/code matching (BM25) via *Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)* to achieve 100% precision on SKU codes and technical terminology.
- [ ] **Complex Table & Unstructured Document Parsing:**
  - Dedicated table segmentation and layout-aware chunking for Excel (`.xlsx`), CSV, and complex multi-column PDF reports.
- [ ] **Hierarchical & Parent-Child Chunking:**
  - Multi-tier indexing that performs granular vector search on small child chunks while providing parent contextual blocks to the LLM during generation.
- [ ] **Graph-Augmented RAG (GraphRAG):**
  - Transform enterprise entities and document relations into Knowledge Graphs for multi-hop causal reasoning and cross-departmental impact analysis.
- [x] **Configurable Chunking Parameters:**
  - Exposed `CHUNK_SIZE` and `CHUNK_OVERLAP` as environment variables instead of hardcoded values in `DocumentLoader`.
- [ ] **Document Versioning & History:**
  - Track document upload/re-upload history with version timestamps and diff metadata.
  - Allow admins to rollback to previous document versions.

## 🤖 Phase 2 — Next-Gen Agentic RAG

- [x] **Multi-Turn Conversational Memory (LangGraph Checkpointer):**
  - Integrated LangGraph SQLite checkpointer (`conversations.db`) and session-based thread tracking (`thread_id`).
  - Contextual retrieval query enrichment and conversational history retention across turns.
- [x] **Dynamic Query Rewriting & Expansion:**
  - Autonomous `rewrite` node in LangGraph that rewrites ambiguous user prompts into optimized search representations before querying the vector store.
  - Resolves pronouns and references using conversation history for multi-turn coherence.
- [x] **Closed-Loop Self-Correction & Refinement:**
  - Integrated `refine` node in LangGraph routed back to `grade` to audit refined responses, ensuring high factual fidelity.
- [x] **Universal Relational Database Connector & Text-to-SQL Tools:**
  - SQLAlchemy-based connector layer supporting PostgreSQL, MSSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite.
  - Strict read-only query guardrails, automatic `LIMIT` capping, and table whitelisting.
  - Table-to-vector ETL pipeline (`DatabaseTableLoader`) and agent tools (`sql_db_query`, `sql_db_schema`).
- [ ] **Multi-Agent Supervisor Teams:**
  - Supervisor pattern to route queries dynamically across specialized agents (Documentation Agent, SQL Data Agent, Code Analysis Agent).
- [x] **User Feedback Loop:**
  - Thumbs up/down feedback buttons in Streamlit UI with `/api/v1/feedback` API endpoint.
  - Feedback events recorded in the compliance audit trail for answer quality tracking.
- [x] **Conversation Session Management:**
  - Admin endpoint `/api/v1/admin/cleanup-sessions` for TTL-based cleanup of expired sessions.
- [x] **SQL Injection Guard Enhancement:**
  - AST-based SQL parser (`sqlparse`) added alongside regex for defense against comment-based bypass and encoding attacks.

## ⚡ Phase 3 — Serving Optimization & Inference Acceleration

- [x] **Request Serialization & Concurrency Protection:**
  - Integrated `QueryConcurrencyManager` with dual-mode support: serialized `asyncio.Lock` for in-process HuggingFace, and parallel `asyncio.Semaphore` for Ollama serving.
- [x] **Optimized Inference Engine Integration (Ollama / vLLM):**
  - First-class Ollama support with `langchain-ollama` (`LLM_BACKEND=ollama`), enabling 7B/14B models (`qwen2.5:7b`, `llama3.1:8b`) and multi-request parallel processing.
  - Optional `ollama` container definition in `docker-compose.yml`.
- [ ] **Semantic Vector Caching:**
  - Cache recurring queries using vector similarity (Redis / GPTCache) to answer repeated enterprise questions with near-zero latency.
- [ ] **Speculative Decoding:**
  - Accelerate local LLM token generation using small draft models.
- [x] **API Rate Limiting:**
  - Per-IP rate limiting middleware in FastAPI with configurable `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` via environment variables.
  - Returns `429 Too Many Requests` with `Retry-After` header.
- [ ] **WebSocket Streaming Support:**
  - Replace NDJSON-based streaming with WebSocket connections for lower-latency, bidirectional real-time communication.

## 🏢 Phase 4 — Enterprise Security, Governance & DevOps

- [x] **Automated Testing Suite (52 Tests):**
  - Comprehensive unit and integration tests covering LangGraph decision branches, read-only SQL guards, file upload security, authentication/RBAC, multi-turn memory, Ollama serving, resource stability, and audit trail logging.
