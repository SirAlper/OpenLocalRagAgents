## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

- Unit tests go in `tests/` with the naming convention `test_<module>.py`
- Use `unittest.mock` for mocking external dependencies (LLM, database, etc.)
- Aim for meaningful test coverage, not just line coverage

---

## 📐 Code Style

- **Python 3.10+** compatibility
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines where practical
